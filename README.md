# Minecraft-map-Republic-of-FlashTeens : A repo for people who cannot access Google drive.
I have been working on a large map "Republic of FlashTeens" since 2015. It is also the first Minecraft project I have ever made, while now it is already a paradise of numerous railway lines based on original techniques with Vanilla Minecraft commands.
  Note: Releases under this brunch is compatible with Minecraft 1.13.2 or higher.
